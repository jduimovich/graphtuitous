# Graphtuitous

Graphtuitous is demo application that uses gratuitious graphs to demonstrate a simple service to demonstrate e2e development, innerloop and outerloop. The service can be scaled, compute altered to demonstrate performance issues, and graph colours will allow visual confirmation of changes.

This app has one endpoint /test and is used to demonstrate simple applications on kubernetes. 

It will return a JSON object. 
```
{ 
        "hostname":"johnpc"
        "version": 1.1, 
        "colour": "blue",
        "count": 1,
        "stack": "runtime used in demo",  
        "loop": 1,
        "compute": "fib(n)",
        "time": 1
      }

``` 
 
`hostname`  Hostname of the pod that executed the service on kubernetes.This can be used to demonstrate replicas, failures
        and scaling.
	
`version` Version of the app that executed the service on kubernetes.  
  
 `colour`    Recommended graphing colour for demo purposes. Used to show live edit, and outerloop changes.
  
 `count`   Returns the number of times this server instance has returned a response.
        When a pod dies and is restarted, the counts restart at zero.
	
`stack`   Name of the runtime used to implement the service. Quarkus, node.js, java. 
        Can be used to demonstrate replacing a service in one language with another one using gitops or adding deployments.
	      
`loop` Loop count on how many times function is run. Currently hardcoded, to be changed to pass as argument.
   
   `compute` Server side function name and parameter as a string. 
  
   `time` Execution time on the server for the specific demo function and loop count.
